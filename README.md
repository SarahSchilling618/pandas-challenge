# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge


This repostiory contains an .ipynb file that can be opened via Jupyter Notebook, which contains analysis of a database based on two csv files, one with a list of schools, and another containing the students that attend these schools. These scripts can be executed by opening GitBash in the folders that the original .cvs files that the data was taken from, opening Jupyter Notebook, and opening the file I have provided. This script was written to act on a specific Jupyter Notebook/pandas workbook as an exercise at the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Bootcamp. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment. I also recieved help from fellow classmate Victoria Martin-Nelson for a small portion of the exercise.
